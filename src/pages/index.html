    <p>Navgurukul offers a fully-funded skilling program in software engineering with guaranteed job to youth from low-income families. The program is for one year and is a residential course.</p>
    <p>Our students come from different parts of the country and are the first person to get higher education in their families and communities, first person to learn technology driven modern skills and get aspirational jobs. The program and its pedagogy
      are focused on nourishing changemakers and free thinkers who would become the light of change in their own communities once they grow professionally.</p>
    <p>When one person steps out of their community to achieve their dreams, she becomes an inspiration to many. Thus, at Navgurukul, we are committed to taking our program to as many communities as possible.</p>
    <p>Our partners help us give access to aspirational careers to youth who want to grow but donâ€™t have means to do so. Our partnerships are the backbone of our operations.</p>
    <p>Our partners share our values, our partners share our impact.</p>

    <p>If you are an organisation or an individual who works with youth and/or in education, we have a great potential to collaborate.</p>
    <p>Our partners motivate and inform their communities about our software engineering program and its benefits. They identify youth who could use this opportunity and conduct the admissions test for them if needed.</p>
    <p>We support our partners in this mobilization process by understanding the needs of the youth in their community, offering them content for information sessions and admissions tests. </p>
    <p>Once the students are selected with the help of any partner, we offer the progress reports of the students to the partner and help them share their inspirational stories in their impact reports and talks. </p>
